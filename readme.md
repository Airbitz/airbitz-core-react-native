# Airbitz Core for React Native

This library is deprecated. Please install [`edge-login`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/edge-login) directly, which now includes built-in support for React Native.

The only change in `edge-login` is that the `makeReactNativeContext` function has been renamed to `makeEdgeContext`. Otherwise it is a drop-in replacement.
